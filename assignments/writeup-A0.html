Step 2: General Setup

No problems encountered; Took maybe 20 to 30 minutes for installation 

Visual Studio:

Step 3: Build and Run

First, I built Scotty on wsl (ubuntu 24.04) - had to install a few g++ dependencies

Then I thought it would be better to build on windows instead, utilizing Visual Stuio

While building on windows I encountered some problem that students mentioned on piazza

1. can't find cl.exe

- I tried adding cl.exe to PATH since I prefer using bash over cmd but just had to default to using x64 Native Tools terminal in the end

2. problem building sejp.cpp regarding std::runtime_error

- followed the steps TA provided on piazza and it worked

It took maybe an hour to figure out what the problem is and address it.

(##) A0T2

Your completion of this task will be graded based on your `test.a0.task2.problems.cpp` file and your responses to the below questions.

For each of the problems you solved in task 2, characterise the bug in your own words and explain one other scenario that may cause this 
type of bug.

Problem 1: 

    type should be std::string. 

    ";" omitted. 

    std::cout typo. 

    should add "#include <string>" for safety.

    other scenarios: not closing parenthesis.

    took a minute

<br>

Problem 2:

    y / factor returns integer division.

    changed factor to float to force float division.

    other scenarios: 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3

    took a minute

<br>

Problem 3:

    vector.end() points to the next position from the end.

    *(one_to_ten.end() - 1) to get the last position.

    other scenarios: calling some_vector.at(100) where it is out of bounds

    took a minute

<br>

Problem 4:

    (a == b) == c => (a == b && b == c)

    other scenarios: a == b == c is same as (a == b) == c, and will create the same problem.

    took a minute

(##) A0T3

You do not need any screenshots for this task. Your completion will be graded based on your `src` submission.

It took maybe half an hour to go through the stack and variables to find out that there's one more vertex than needed.
